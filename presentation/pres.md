# Managing Multidimensional Arrays
## An xarray tutorial
---

# Introduction
## Janukan Sivajeyan, PhD student @ UAlberta
- Reducing Heat Generated By High Intensity Lasers
- Simulations with TBs of array data
## Materials
- will be on github [code/presentation]
---
# What are arrays
- A 1D array is an ordered collection of values (numbers in our case)
- Can represent vectors
## Values
```
[9, 4, 3, 5, 4]
```

## Position [Index]
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
---
# 2D Arrays
- 2D arrays are ordered square of numbers
- Can represent matrices
## Values
```
[[9, 8, 7],
 [6, 5, 4],
 [3, 2, 1]]
```

---

# 2D Arrays
- The 2D arrays have 2 element __indices__

## Position [Index]
```
[[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)],
 [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)],
 [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]]
```
---

# 3D Arrays
- 3D arrays can be cubes of values 
- 3 element __indices__ i.e. (x,y,z)
- Can represent a tensor
# 4D Arrays
- 4D arrays would require 4 element coordinates 
- Easiest to visualize as a 3D array changing in time
- Can represent a tensor

---
# Applications
- Quantities at various points in space and time
- Geospatial Data, Simulation Data
- Neural Network Weights [2D] 
- Media [Music, Photos, Videos]
## Programming
- Languages: MATLAB, Fortran, J, APL
- Libraries: numpy, dask, pytorch

# Indexing Issues
Common indexing issues with arrays
- Mapping physical coordinates to indexes
- Order of coordinates: (x,y,z) vs. (x,z,y)
## Example
I have a 2D array of temperatures [temp] and I want to find the values at Norquest
```

temp[25,46]

```
---
# Indexing Issues
```
temp[25,46]
```
## 25 and 46 are indices
- the data maps to physical coordinates
- numpy handles indices not coordinates
- "manual" translation between coords. and indices

---
# Indexing Issues
```
temp[25,46]
```
## Which one is which?
- one dimension is longitude, other is latitude
- in numpy, you have to "keep track" of order
- flipping indices will cause issues [wrong/invalid]
---
# xarray
Python library for managing arrays with 2 main features
- __Labeling__: Combine arrays with coordinate vectors
- __Ecosystem__: Integrates with other array libraries i.e scipy, matplotlib
Reduce some of the "manual effort" with array programming

# Image Arrays
Images can be represented as 3D arrays

## Dimensions
- Length
- Width
- Colour: Red, Green, Blue

## Values
Array values are floats between 0 and 1

---

# Procedural Image Generation
Creating randomly generated images 
1. Low Resolution Random Noise
2. "Smooth" the noise
3. Image manipulation [Math on arrays]
